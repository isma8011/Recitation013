					Welcome to my portfolio page. My name is Isabella MacDonald and I am currently in my
					sophomore year of college at CU Boulder. I'm majoring in Creative Technology Design,
					and here you will find examples of my work both leading up to and including my college
					endeavors. Aside from the work I've done in school, I also enjoy video games and art
					as hobbies in my free time. Everything you see on this site, including the site itself,
					was made by me! I enjoy web, graphic, and game design, as well as multiple art mediums.
