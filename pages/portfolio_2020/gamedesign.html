				<p>
					As a final project for my design class, I was tasked with creating a game in GB Studio.
					This was a culmination of both code knowledge and creative illustration, as the backgrounds
					and various visual assets were created by me using Paint Tool SAI. The script and general ideas
					behind the game were also a product of the design process, as I brainstormed and prototyped
					potential versions of the game. It is playable through the widget below. <b>
					(A note to those viewing on laptop: the controls are Enter to start, X and Z to interact, and
					WASD or arrow keys to move.)</b>
