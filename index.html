      <i>Interpreter of Maladies</i> is a book written by Jhumpa Lahiri that was published in 1999. It is a fictional
          series of short stories that share a common theme centered around Lahiri's Indian heritage. Though each story
          focuses on a different set of characters, they are tied together by the overarching emotional connections the
          author highlights through beautifully written prose. It won the Pulitizer Prize for Fiction after being published,
          a testament to the moving work of art Lahiri produced.

        About the Author
    </h2>

    <p>
        Jhumpa Lahiri was born in London, but raised in Rhode Island, the daughter of Bengali immigrants. The experiences of
        the characters in <i>Interpreter of Maladies</i> draw much inspiration from her own childhood and upbringing, where
        she often felt torn between her heritage and the country she was growing up in. Despite this, she pursued multiple
        degrees in English and literature, eventually becoming a professor at Princeton University.
